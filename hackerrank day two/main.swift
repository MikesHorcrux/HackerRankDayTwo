//Objective
//In this challenge, you'll work with arithmetic operators. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!
//
//Task
//Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost.
//
//Note: Be sure to use precise values for your calculations, or you may end up with an incorrectly rounded result!
//
//Input Format
//
//There are
//lines of numeric input:
//The first line has a double, (the cost of the meal before tax and tip).
//The second line has an integer, (the percentage of being added as tip).
//The third line has an integer, (the percentage of
//
//being added as tax).
//
//Output Format
//
//Print the total meal cost, where
//is the rounded integer result of the entire bill ( with added tax and tip).

import Foundation

// Complete the solve function below.

    totalCost = round(totalCost)
